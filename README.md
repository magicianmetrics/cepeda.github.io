## About me

I will graduate this summer from the Analysis and Policy in Economics programm at [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/).

Formerly, I studied my BA and MSc at [Centro de Invesitgación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/) in Mexico.

I am interested in the intersection of political economics, historical and social economics. 
I have worked on the persistent effects of colonial segregation, the racial income gap in Latin America, preferences for redistribution in Mexico, and the role of leaders during the Covid-19 pandemic.
