## About me

I am an Economics PhD student at [Paris School of Economics (PSE)](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/).

Formerly, I studied my BA and MSc at [Centro de Invesitgación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE)](https://www.cide.edu/de/) in Mexico, and the Analysis and Policy in Economics program master at [PSE](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/teaching/masters-program/ape-analysis-policy-in-economics/) in France.

I am interested in the intersection of political economy, historical economics, and cultural economics. 
I have worked on the persistent effects of colonial segregation, the racial income gap in Latin America, preferences for redistribution in Mexico, and the role of leaders during the Covid-19 pandemic.

### Working Papers

#### [Unveiling the Cosmic Race: Racial Inequalities in Latin America](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3870741)

Latin America is one of the regions with the highest income inequality and one of the most racially diverse. Historically, most Latin American countries build their national identities through a 'melting pot' ethnic figure: 'mestizos' or 'mulatos' —the mixed-race descendent from European, Indigenous, and African population. However, Latin American countries have veiled income inequalities between racial groups through mestizaje identity or the 'Cosmic Race'. Using LAPOP AmericasBarometer data, I compile information on skin tone and proxies for income for nearly 150,000 individuals across Latin American countries during the last decade. The purpose of the paper is twofold. In the first part, I estimate newly racial inequality measures at the national level. Countries with higher income inequality between racial groups have worse economic development: a one percent increase in the ratio of racial over total income inequality correlates with a decrease of nearly 4 percent in GDP per capita. In the second part of the paper, I use a Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and control functions to analyze the racial income gap at the individual level. Every darker skin tone out of an eleven-color palette has at least 6 percent less monthly income per capita. More than half of the effect cannot be attributed to returns to observable average characteristics of the racial groups. There is substantial heterogeneity between countries. Besides taste-based racial discrimination, other mechanisms are statistical discrimination and occupational segregation. Alongside justice and reparations, progressive taxation in income or 'tagging' could decrease race-based disparities and improve economic development.

#### [Moral Force: Leaders' Actions and Social Distancing](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3678980)
(with María Montoya-Aguirre and Federico Daverio-Occhini)

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders' actions can influence whether individuals stay at home or ignore social distancing orders. Mexican president López Obrador held public events in different states of the country during the health emergency. This paper studies whether his example of contravening social distancing recommendations increases mobility rates. Using mobility data from UNDP-GRANDATA and a generalized event study design, we find that AMLO's public appearances increased mobility rates in the municipalities of the states he visited in the days following the events. Furthermore, using electoral data from the 2018 presidential election, we also find that mobility rates increase in municipalities where his political support is high after the president's events. We find that media coverage is the primary mechanism driving our results. Lastly, in the pandemic's advanced stages, the president's example does not affect mobility. The results suggest that leaders' actions are relevant to influence decisions when individuals have limited information.
