  <blockquote>
    We investigate the persistent impact of a colonial segregation policy on land values in modern Mexico City. During colonial times, Indigenous communities were confined —with varying degrees of success— to settlements known as pueblos de indios.  Using historical records, we exploit quasi-random variation in these pueblos' size and use a Regression Discontinuity Design to estimate the causal effects of the pueblos on land prices. We find a 5% land value penalty for areas affected by the colonial policy. The penalty is exacerbated for the pueblos formerly inhabited exclusively by Indigenous populations.  Historical evidence and novel digitized maps reveal that these land value penalties have been driven over the past two centuries by low public goods provision and negative economic expectations. Moreover, in contemporary data, we observe discontinuities in socioeconomic sorting into the affected pueblos as well as in their public goods quality. Our results underscore the long-lasting repercussions of colonial policies on contemporary spatial equilibria, clarifying the mechanisms driving historical persistence and offering implications for urban policies.

**[Skin Tone Penalties: Bottom-up Discrimination in Football](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4537612)**  *with [Donia Kamel](https://www.doniakamel.com/home){:target="_blank"}.*

<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>  
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    This paper investigates colorism, racial discrimination based on skin color, in men's football. Firstly, using machine learning algorithms, we extract players' skin tones from online headshots to examine their impact on fan-based ratings and valuations. We find evidence of a skin tone penalty, where darker-skinned players face lower fan-driven market values and ratings. Secondly, using algorithm-based ratings and employing a Difference-in-Discontinuities design with geolocated penalty kicks data, we show that lighter-skinned players enjoy a premium higher by one standard deviation than their darker-skinned peers, conditional on scoring a penalty. 
Additionally, we find evidence that non-native players with dark skin face a double penalty. 
Leveraging the COVID-19 pandemic as a natural experiment, we highlight the role of fans' stadium attendance in algorithm-based results. 
The findings underscore direct skin tone discrimination in football and highlight fans' role in perpetuating algorithmic bias.

**[Unveiling the Cosmic Race: Skin Tone Disparities in Latin America](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3870741){:target="_blank"}**.

[WIL Working Paper](https://wid.world/document/unveiling-the-cosmic-race-racial-inequalities-in-latin-america-world-inequality-lab-working-paper-2022-02/){:target="_blank"} 

<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>  
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    Could physical traits drive racial inequalities rather than ethnoracial identities? This paper investigates descriptive skin tone-based disparities across 25 Latin American countries. Using a nine-tone color palette, darker skin tones correlate with lower household income per capita, fewer years of schooling, and a 2 percentage point decrease in upward educational mobility. The direct and indirect skin tone disparities persist after bounding the estimates for unobserved heterogeneity. The skin tone gradients are present across different ethnoracial and gender groups and vary widely across countries. Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions suggest that discrimination likely drives a substantial portion of these gaps.

  <summary> Abstract </summary>  
  <br>
  <blockquote>
  In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders' actions can influence whether individuals stay at home or ignore social distancing orders. Mexican president López Obrador held public events in different states of the country during the health emergency. This paper studies whether his example of contravening social distancing recommendations increases mobility rates. Using mobility data from UNDP-GRANDATA and a generalized event study design, we find that AMLO's public appearances increased mobility rates in the municipalities of the states he visited in the days following the events. Furthermore, using electoral data from the 2018 presidential election, we also find that mobility rates increase in municipalities where his political support is high after the president's events. We find that media coverage is the primary mechanism driving our results. Lastly, in the pandemic's advanced stages, the president's example does not affect mobility. The results suggest that leaders' actions are relevant to influence decisions when individuals have limited information.

**[Populism's Original Sin: Short-term Populist Penalties and Uncertainty Traps](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4881610){:target="_blank"}**  

<details>
  <summary> Abstract </summary>  
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    This paper investigates the immediate economic impacts of populist policies. In 2018, the Mexican president-elect held an unofficial referendum with less than 1% turnout to halt the construction of Mexico City's New International Airport. I show that the policy is plausibly a natural experiment with nationwide impacts, preceding other macroeconomic shocks and populist policies dismantling economic and institutional checks. Using the synthetic control method, I find a 3% to 4% GDP reduction one year post-cancellation. Consistent with the uncertainty trap framework, this decline is due to heightened economic uncertainty and a significant drop in investment, reinforcing each other and leading to a prolonged economic downturn.
